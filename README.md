Sorting Hat!

The Sorting Hat uses a ten question survey to determine the user's most compatible house. The user responds to questions with values from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). When the survey is complete, the user is matched with the house that has the lowest absolute difference for all ten questions combined. 

The Sorting Hat application uses Node.js and Express server on the back end.
